# Search-Bot
This script was written keeping in mind the objective to create a Turing machine!!

What the script does is that it takes in an input from the user and then eliminates the stopwords from the user's input and finds the remaining words on google as it's search query!

I'd want to take it further by adding more filters to make the script reply to the user's question as if it were in a conversation.

As of now, it basically searches on google and relies with the content on the search result. In case I'm totally off the mark, I've tried to add a link which the user can further navigate to look upon.

Hence, the repository name is SEARCH_BOT rather than a chat bot/Turing machine.

P.S: The file 'english1' is my own curated list of stopwords rather than using the stopwords given with nltk corpora.
